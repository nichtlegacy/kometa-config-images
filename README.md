# 🎬 LEGACY Kometa Config & Images

<p align="center">
  <img src="screenshots/nichtlegacy_banner.png" alt="kometa-config-images Banner" />
</p>

Custom images and YAML configurations for [Kometa](https://kometa.wiki), built to supercharge your Plex experience with smart collections, overlays, and metadata magic.

The posters are generated using [Posterizarr](https://github.com/fscorrupt/Posterizarr) and then managed via [Kometa](https://kometa.wiki) to create collections and apply overlays automatically.  
I'm using a mix of artwork from [Posterizarr](https://github.com/fscorrupt/Posterizarr), [ThePosterDB](https://theposterdb.com), and [MediUX](https://mediux.pro).

All posters for the [**Universes**](#-universes) and [**Movie Lists**](#-movie-lists) were custom-designed by me using Photoshop and are located in the `/posters/` folder.  
Posters for [**Actors**](#-actors), [**Directors**](#-directors), [**Decades**](#-decades), [**Studios**](#-studios--originals), and [**Originals**](#-studios--originals) are sourced from TMDb, IMDb, or ThePosterDB.
